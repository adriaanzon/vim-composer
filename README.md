## Features

Composer.vim provides conveniences for working with Composer PHP projects.
Some features include:

* `:Composer` command wrapper around `composer` with smart completion
* Projectionist support (e.g., `:Ecomposer` to edit your `composer.json`, `:A`
  to jump to `composer.lock` and back)
* Dispatch support (`:Dispatch` runs `composer install`)

See `:help composer` for details.

## Installation

Composer.vim depends on [Projectionist.vim][projectionist] and has an optional
dependency on [Dispatch.vim][dispatch] for asynchronous execution of Composer
commands.

	Plug 'tpope/vim-dispatch'
	Plug 'tpope/vim-projectionist'
	Plug 'noahfrederick/vim-composer'

## Features

Composer.vim provides conveniences for working with Composer PHP projects.
Some features include:

* `:Composer` command wrapper around `composer` with smart completion
* Navigate to source files using Composer's autoloader
* Insert `use` statement for the class/interface/trait under cursor
* [Projectionist][projectionist] support (e.g., `:Ecomposer` to edit your
  `composer.json`, `:A` to jump to `composer.lock` and back)
* [Dispatch][dispatch] support (`:Dispatch` runs `composer install`)

See `:help composer` for details.

## Installation

Composer.vim depends on [Projectionist.vim][projectionist]:

	Plug 'tpope/vim-projectionist'
	Plug 'noahfrederick/vim-composer'

INTRODUCTION                                                  *composer-intro*

Composer.vim provides conveniences for working with Composer PHP projects.
Some features include:

  * |:Composer| command wrapper around composer with smart completion
  * Projectionist support (e.g., :Ecomposer to edit your composer.json, :A to
    jump to composer.lock and back)
  * Dispatch support (|:Dispatch| runs composer install)

This plug-in is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                   *composer-commands*

:Composer[!] [arguments]                                           *:Composer*
  Invoke Composer with [arguments] (with intelligent completion, including
  completion for package names on packagist.org).

==============================================================================
AUTOCOMMANDS                                           *composer-autocommands*

If you want to set your own Vim settings for buffers belonging to your
Composer project, you may do so from your vimrc using an autocommand:
>
  autocmd User Composer nnoremap <buffer> <F2> :Composer dump-autoload<CR>
<
